1. Apply otz_linux.patch
2. Copy linux-2.6.38.7.tar.bz2
3. #make ; 
4. Apply first_guest_partition.patch 
5. #make clean; make;
6. Copy fastmodel_ve_defconfig to arch/arm/configs of both 
   linux guest directories.
7. #make

This is a temporary arrangement until we merge the linux guest changes
for both trustzone based hypervisor and A15 based hypervisor.
