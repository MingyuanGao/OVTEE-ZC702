/** @mainpage Open Virtualization
*
* <hr>
* Open Virtualization is a secure kernel that leverage's the TrustZone(R)
* architecture extensions in <a
* href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/trustzone.php">ARM(R)</a>
* processors. The Open Virtualization kernel can be run in parallel with a more
* full-featured operating system, such as Linux, Android, or BSD, on the same 
* core. Open Virtualization uses security extensions to completely protect the
* secure kernel and peripherals from code running in the primary operating 
* system. This means that even if an attacker manages to obtain full supervisor 
* privileges to the primary operating system, the attacker cannot gain 
* access to the secure kernel.
